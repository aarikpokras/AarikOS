#==============================#

Welcome to AarikOS! This is a detailed guide on how to compile and prepare it for flashing.

#==================#
#   Requirements   #
#==================#

* xorriso
* Makefile/build-essential
* Flashing software like unetbootin (read below)

#=================#
#   Compilation   #
#=================#

Unlike some other ones, these makefiles actually *work*. Run `./configure` and follow the instructions. DO NOT run the `makeiso` file by itself. It is only intended to be run indirectly by other shell scripts.
For the most part, AarikOS is pretty small, so you can just use your good ol' SanDisk Cruzer Glide. If you don't have one, I'd recommend getting it. It's good.

#================#
#   unetbootin   #
#================#

You can download and install unetbootin at unetbootin.github.io.
